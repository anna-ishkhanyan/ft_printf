# FT_PRINTF

This repository contains my implementation of 'ft_printf', a project from the 42 curriculum designed to replicate the behavior of the standard printf function in C. The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of variadic functions, formatted output, and string manipulation. Additionally, this project includes libft, a library of commonly used C functions.

## Requirements

To use this library, you need:

+ a C compiler (e.g., gcc)
+ 'make' utility

## Variadic Functions
Variadic functions are functions that accept a variable number of arguments. The standard printf function is a well-known example of a variadic function. These functions are useful when the number of arguments is not known at compile time.

## Format Specifiers

ft_printf supports the following format specifiers:

+ %c: Character
+ %s: String
+ %p: Pointer address
+ %d: Decimal integer
+ %i: Integer
+ %u: Unsigned integer
+ %x: Hexadecimal (lowercase)
+ %X: Hexadecimal (uppercase)
+ %%: Percent sign
